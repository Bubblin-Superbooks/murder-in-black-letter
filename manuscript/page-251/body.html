<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"A couple of strangers were in here last Thursday night. They introduced themselves to Guido, stood him drinks, talked at length. All this was noticed by the bartender, without any special interest, simply because it was a slack midweek night. He didn't hear what was said. After closing time, Guido went out with them.</p><p>"The description of one of those birds answers moderately well to Bob's description of Larkin."</p><p>Corinna shook herself, as if something rode her neck. "Is that all?" she asked.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"It could be worse," she said. "We already know he knows Larkin."</p><p>"What did the other man look like?" asked Kintyre.</p><p>"Smallish fellow, sandy-haired, long nose. And I'm surprised the barkeep could tell me that much. Look how you've come right back in here tonight, a stranger, after tearing the joint up."</p></div> </div>
